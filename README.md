# Service Provider Application

This Service Provider Application is designed to manage household chores by connecting customers with service providers. The application consists of two main dashboards: one for customers and another for service providers. Both types of users can register, log in, and manage their profiles independently. The service providers can add, update, and delete the services they offer, while customers can browse and book these services based on their requirements.
